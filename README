In order to run the frontend, the backend must also be running

Running the backend
--------------------
After you have cloned the repository from github, go to folder java/webshop-backend/ and type:

	mvn exec:java
	
If this is the first time that the server is run, Maven will download the necessary dependencies, so it may take a while.

You can check that the backend is running by pointing your browser to http://localhost:9998/item/2. You should get a nice Json response.

Running the frontend
--------------------
In order to run the frontend Scala application, go to folder scala/dl-comp-frotend/ and type:

		mvn jetty:run
		
Again, if this is the first time that the server is run Maven will download all the necessary dependecies. 

The Scala application runs in http://localhost:8080/
