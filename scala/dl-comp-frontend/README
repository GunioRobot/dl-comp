How to get started
-------------------
1) Install the Scala plugin for Eclipse. Use the following URL as the source for the software in Eclipse 
via (Help->Install new software...): http://www.scala-lang.org/node/94

2) Install the Egit plugin for Eclipse. Use this URL for the software download: http://download.eclipse.org/egit/updates

3) Import the project data from the git repository:

3.1) In eclipse, go to File->Import...
3.2) Select "Git Repository" under Git
3.3) Enter the following data in the URI field: git+ssh://git@github.com/phunkphorce/dl-comp.git. Let 
the git importer fill in the rest of values
3.4) Select the master branch
3.5) Select where to import the project and click Finish

Once completed, you should have the "dl-comp-frontend" project installed in your Eclipse.

How to commit files
-------------------
1) make your changes to the file. If it's a new file:
1.1) Make sure you add it to the repository by right clicking on it, then select
Team->Add to Version Control
2) Commit your changes: "Team->Commit..." Write a relevant comment
3) Once done, right click on the project name and then select Team->Push To... For some reason it is not possible
to just select the default folder that we configured so we need to write the server and account settings to get it to push
Use the following settings: 

URI: git+ssh://git@github.com/phunkphorce/dl-comp.git
Host: github.com
Repository path: /phunkphorce/dl-comp.git
Protocol: git+ssh
User: git
Password: you can type it now or you will be asked later

In the next screen, click "Add all branches spec" and click Finish. If everything went well
you should see a message in green background with the push id.
